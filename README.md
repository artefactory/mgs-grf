> **Abstract:** *This study investigates rare event detection on tabular data within binary classification. Many real-world classification tasks, such as in banking sector, deal with mixed features, which have a significant impact on predictive performances. To this purpose, we introduce MGS-GRF, an oversampling strategy designed for mixed features. This method uses a kernel density estimator with locally estimated full-rank covariances to generate continuous features, while categorical ones are drawn from the original samples through a generalized random forest.*

You will find code to reproduce the paper experiments as well as an nice implementation of our *new* and *efficient* strategy for your projects.

## üõ† Installation

First you can clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:artefactory/mgs-grf.git
```

## üöÄ How to use the MGS-GRF Algorithm to learn on imbalanced data
Here is a short example on how to use MGS-GRF: 
```python
from mgs_grf import MGSGRFOverSampler

## Apply MGS-GRF procedure to oversample the data
mgs_grf = MGSGRFOverSampler(K=len(numeric_features),categorical_features=categorical_features,random_state=0)
balanced_X, balanced_y = mgs_grf.fit_resample(X_train,y_train)
print("Augmented data : ", Counter(balanced_y))

## Encode the categorical variables
enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore',sparse_output=False)
balanced_X_encoded = enc.fit_transform(balanced_X[:,categorical_features])
balanced_X_final = np.hstack((balanced_X[:,numeric_features],balanced_X_encoded))

# Fit the final classifier on the augmented data
clf_mgs = lgb.LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100,verbosity=-1, random_state=0)
clf_mgs.fit(balanced_X_final, balanced_y)

```
A more detailed notebook example is available in [this notebook](example/example.ipynb).


## ‚≠ê Reproducing the paper experiments

If you want to reproduce our paper experiments:
  - Section 4.2 : the [Python file](protocols/run_synthetic_coherence.py) reproduces the experiments (data sets, oversampling and traing). Then the results can be analyzed with [this notebook](protocols/notebooks/res_coh.ipynb).
  - Section 4.3 : the   [Python file](protocols/run_synthetic_association.py) reproduces the experiments (data sets, oversampling and traing). Then the results can be analyzed with [this notebook](protocols/notebooks/res_asso.ipynb).
  - Section 5 : the [Python file](protocols/run_protocol-final.py) reproduces the experiments (data sets, oversampling and traing). Then the results can be analyzed with [this notebook](protocols/notebooks/res_real_data.ipynb).
