## ⭐ Getting Started

If you want to reproduce our paper experiments:
  - the notebooks [here](notebooks/classif_experiments.ipynb) and [here](notebooks/distances_experiments.ipynb) reproduce the experiments
  - thise [code](./validation) contains implementation the protocols used for the numerical experiments of our article. 

In order to use our MGS strategy:
  - this [notebook](notebooks/resampling_example.ipynb) illustrates how to use it
  - the strategy is implemented [here](./oversampling_strategies/)

## ⭐ Data sets

The data sets of used for our article should be dowloaded  inside the *data/externals* folder. The data sets are available at the followings adresses :
