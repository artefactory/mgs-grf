> **Abstract:** *This study investigates rare event detection on tabular data within binary classification. Many real-world classification tasks, such as in banking sector, deal with mixed features, which have a significant impact on predictive performances. To this purpose, we introduce MGS-GRF, an oversampling strategy designed for mixed features. This method uses a kernel density estimator with locally estimated full-rank covariances to generate continuous features, while categorical ones are drawn from the original samples through a generalized random forest.*

You will find code to reproduce the paper experiments.

## üõ† Installation

First you can clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:artefactory/mgs-grf.git
```

## üî¨ Reproducing the paper experiments

If you want to reproduce our paper experiments:
  - Section 4.2 : the [Python file](protocols/run_synthetic_coherence.py) reproduces the experiments (data sets, oversampling and traing). Then the results can be analyzed with [this notebook](protocols/notebooks/res_coh.ipynb).
  - Section 4.3 : the   [Python file](protocols/run_synthetic_association.py) reproduces the experiments (data sets, oversampling and traing). Then the results can be analyzed with [this notebook](protocols/notebooks/res_asso.ipynb).
  - Section 5 : the [Python file](protocols/run_protocol-final.py) reproduces the experiments (data sets, oversampling and traing). Then the results can be analyzed with [this notebook](protocols/notebooks/res_real_data.ipynb).

## üíæ Data sets
